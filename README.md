This is our website for Jackson Hospital Foundation's art gallery.
The site is hosted [here](http://boros.site/jacksonArt/gallery.html). Note: This may not be up-to-date.

## Brochure
A PDF of the brochure that we were given is located [here](http://www.jackson.org/media/1322/art-brochure-4-panel-3-16-17.pdf)

### Problems with the Brochure.
#### Font
The font in the Brochure is mostly Microsoft's proprietary fonts. Here is a table of the font used and our alternative:

| Proprietary Font | Our Font          |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Garamond Italic  | EB Garamond       |
| Avenir           | Lato              |
| New Baskerville  | Libre Baskerville |
| Times New Roman  | Tinos             |

## TODO:
* Possible Search Bar. - low priority
* Menu Third Floor Dropdown
* HomeScreen
* Image Viewer.
* How long is the image comments going to be? 
* Navbar cuts off top image on mobile.
* Framing around thumbnails and thumbnail tags.
* Browser navigation
